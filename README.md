These instructions ensure that users are aware of how to interact with the map features directly using Leaflet's built-in tools for a more dynamic experience. Including screenshots for each step helps visually guide the user through the process, making it easier to understand.


### Searching for a Feature
**By Description:**
1. Simply enter a keyword into the search box located in the sidebar.
2. Click "Search" to find and display matching features. If the search box is left blank, all features will be listed as results in the sidebar.
3. Click on a feature's name in the results to highlight and zoom into the selected feature on the map and view or edit its details in the sidebar form.

**By Name:**
If you search by name, the map will zoom directly to the feature that matches the name you've entered. This is useful for quickly locating a specific feature on the map.

This functionality enhances user interaction by allowing not only targeted searches but also providing an overview of all features when no specific query is entered. The sidebar effectively serves as a dynamic legend or directory of map content, which can be particularly useful in urban planning contexts where understanding the entire landscape is beneficial.

### Saving Your Map Data
- Click the "Save Map Data" button below the map to save all current features and their details to your local storage.

## Tips
- Zoom in or out on the map for better precision while adding or editing features.
- Regularly save your data to ensure no progress is lost.
