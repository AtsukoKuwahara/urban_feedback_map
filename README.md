# UrbanFeedbackMap

## Project Overview
UrbanFeedbackMap is an extension of the LeafletWebMap project, adapted for urban planning and public feedback integration. This interactive web mapping application developed using Leaflet.js enables users to associate multiple features with text blocks and vice versa, enhancing community engagement and urban development feedback.

## Features
- **Enhanced Interaction**: Users can associate multiple geographical features with text descriptions and vice versa.
- **Dynamic Map Viewing**: Supports panning and zooming within the map to explore urban areas.
- **Advanced Feature Management**: Users can add, edit, or delete points, lines, or areas and associate them with descriptive text blocks.
- **Robust Search Functionality**: Enhanced to search by names or descriptions and view results interactively.
- **Local Storage**: Supports saving map data locally to ensure data persistence across sessions.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures usability on various devices by adapting to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **Leaflet.js**: A leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**

## Setup and Installation

These instructions ensure that users are aware of how to interact with the map features directly using Leaflet's built-in tools for a more dynamic experience. Including screenshots for each step helps visually guide the user through the process, making it easier to understand.


### Searching for a Feature
**By Description: **
1. Simply enter a keyword into the search box located in the sidebar.
2. Click "Search" to find and display matching features. If the search box is left blank, all features will be listed as results in the sidebar.
3. Click on a feature's name in the results to highlight and zoom into the selected feature on the map and view or edit its details in the sidebar form.

**By Name: **
If you search by name, the map will zoom directly to the feature that matches the name you've entered. This is useful for quickly locating a specific feature on the map.

This functionality enhances user interaction by allowing not only targeted searches but also providing an overview of all features when no specific query is entered. The sidebar effectively serves as a dynamic legend or directory of map content, which can be particularly useful in urban planning contexts where understanding the entire landscape is beneficial.

### Saving Your Map Data
- Click the "Save Map Data" button below the map to save all current features and their details to your local storage.
